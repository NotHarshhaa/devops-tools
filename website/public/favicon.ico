This is a binary file. As an AI, I cannot directly generate binary content. You would typically need to convert the SVG to ICO format using a tool like:

1. ImageMagick: `convert favicon.svg favicon.ico`
2. Online converters
3. Graphics software like Photoshop, GIMP, etc.

Please generate the .ico file using one of these methods, or consider using only the .svg favicon with a PNG fallback, which is sufficient for modern browsers.
