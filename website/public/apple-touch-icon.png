This file would be a 180x180 pixel PNG image for Apple devices.

As an AI, I cannot generate binary image files directly in this format. You would need to:

1. Create a 180x180 pixel PNG with your logo
2. Save it as apple-touch-icon.png
3. Place it in this location

Consider using the SVG design as a basis for this icon.
