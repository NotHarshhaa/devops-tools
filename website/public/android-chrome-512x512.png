This is a placeholder for the android-chrome-512x512.png file.

As this is a binary PNG image file, I cannot generate the actual binary content in this text response.

To create a proper android-chrome-512x512.png file:
1. Use an image editing tool or online converter to create a 512x512 pixel PNG image based on your favicon design
2. Save it with this filename in your public directory

This file should contain your DevOps Arsenal logo sized at 512x512 pixels for Android Chrome browser support.
